ZXing (pronounced "zebra crossing") is an open-source, multi-format 1D/2D barcode image processing library implemented in Java, with ports to other languages. Our focus is on using the built-in camera on mobile phones to scan and decode barcodes on the device, without communicating with a server. However the project can be used to encode and decode barcodes on desktops and servers as well. We currently support these formats:

UPC-A and UPC-E
EAN-8 and EAN-13
Code 39
Code 93
Code 128
ITF
Codabar
RSS-14 (all variants)
RSS Expanded (most variants)
QR Code
Data Matrix
Aztec ('beta' quality)
PDF 417 ('alpha' quality)
This library is divided into several main components which are actively supported:

core: The core image decoding library, and test code
javase: J2SE-specific client code
zxingorg: The source behind zxing.org/w
android: Android client, called Barcode Scanner
androidtest: Android test app
android-integration: Supports integration with our Barcode Scanner app via Intent

There are also additional modules which are contributed and/or intermittently maintained:

cpp: Partial C++ port
iphone: iPhone client + port to Objective C / C++ (QR code only)
zxing.appspot.com: The source behind our web-based barcode generator
csharp: Partial C# port
jruby: Ruby wrapper
actionscript: partial port to Actionscript
