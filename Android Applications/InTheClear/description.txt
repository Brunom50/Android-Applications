Java and Android mobile alerting and secure wipe application(s).

InTheClear is a suite of mobile applications designed to keep users safer in difficult situations by using their phone's built-in tools. At its core are two main features: Emergency SMS and Data Wipe. At installation, InTheClear walks a new user through the process of configuring each of these features. The user can then activate either Emergency SMS or Data Wipe individually, on an ad-hoc basis. In addition, they can simultaneously activate *both* Emergency SMS and Data Wipe via Panic!, a simple, one-touch feature of InTheClear.
