This application is, as its name says, an explorer for permissions. It shows users a complete list of the permissions existent in their Android systems. For the most common permissions some functional demos have been implemented, demonstrating what can an application with that permission can do (never causing damage to the user without their consent, but aiming to have enough impact for the user to understand the complete possibilities of the permission). Accompanying the "demonstrations of power", the user can see which applications currently installed in the system have a given permission, so the user can develop a critical mind about the need each application has of the permissions it requested at installation time.
