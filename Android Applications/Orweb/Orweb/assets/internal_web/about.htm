<h3>Orweb 1.0.0</h3>

<p>The Orweb browser is based on open-source code released by the Shadow project.
Modifications to the original source code were made to fix issues with https connection,
and to enable the browser to connect to Orbot, the offical port of Tor on Android. This application
requires Orbot to be installed and activated for anonymous web access to function.
