	<string name="help_conenctors">There is a huge number of Connectors available in Android Market.\nPress the button below and install the Connector which suits you best.\nFor users without an account at any of the service, I recommend cherry-sms for almost everybody. Users with non latin alphabets might want to try my-cool-sms first.</string>
