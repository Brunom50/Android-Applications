Android-Applications
====================
A collection of cleanly compiling Android apps for SDK 14

- Each folder in collection contains a unique project that consists of one or more Eclipse project files (if there are dependencies).
- Each top level project folder contains a source.txt file with information on where the open source Android application was obtained
- Each application is tested and compiled to SDK 14
- Applications may be renamed to make naming unique/consistant/etc.
- All other source is unchanged
