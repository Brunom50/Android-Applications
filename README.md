Android-Applications
====================
A collection of cleanly compiling Android apps (non-malware) for SDK 15

Note: This is a public repo, please don't put private analysis files in this repo.

- Each folder in collection contains a unique project that consists of one or more Eclipse project files (if there are dependencies).
- Each top level project folder contains a source.txt file with information on where the open source Android application was obtained
- Each application is tested and compiled to SDK 15
- Applications may be renamed to make naming unique/consistant/etc.
- Source is unversioned from any version control system
- Removed any unit testing or test code
- Added missing dependency libraries when needed
- Minor fixes to make code compile if broken
- All other source is unchanged
